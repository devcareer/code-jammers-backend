  about: `Lusaka, city, capital of Zambia. It is situated in the south-central part of the country on a limestone plateau 4,198 feet 
          (1,280 metres) above sea level.
          In the 1890s the area in which Lusaka is situated was taken over by the British South Africa Company from the local chiefs 
          in the course of the formation of Northern Rhodesia, with control passing to the British Colonial Office in 1924. Lusaka 
          became the capital of Northern Rhodesia in 1935. The city figured prominently in the movement for independence and was where 
          the Federation of African Societies founded the Northern Rhodesian Congress in 1948. After the federation of Northern and 
          Southern Rhodesia took place in 1953, Lusaka was a hub of the civil disobedience movement (1960) that led to the creation of 
          the independent state of Zambia, of which Lusaka became the capital.`,

  about: `history of Nigeria can be traced to settlers trading across the middle East and Africa as early as 1100 BC. Numerous ancient 
          African civilizations settled in the region that is known today as Nigeria, such as the village of Nri, the Benin Empire, and 
          the Oyo village. Islam reached Nigeria through the Borno Empire between (1068 AD) and Hausa States around (1385 AD) during the 
          11th century,[1][2][3][4] while Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th century through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from 
          Portugal. The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region.`,
