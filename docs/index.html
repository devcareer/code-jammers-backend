        <h2>Devcareer Know Africa Project Privacy Policy</h2>

        <h4> The short version</h4>

       <p> 
        We are a team of learning software engineers at DevCareer, and we are building an application called Know Africa.
        It is not a real project such that whatever data is collected is possibly ours used in testing the Facebook OAuth application.
